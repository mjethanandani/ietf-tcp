    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a YANG model for TCP on devices that are
      configured by network management protocols. The YANG model defines a
      container for all TCP connections and groupings of some of the
      parameters that can be imported and used in TCP implementations or by
      other models that need to configure TCP parameters. The model includes
      definitions from YANG Groupings for TCP Client and TCP Servers
      (I-D.ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server). The model is NMDA (RFC 8342)
      compliant.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The <xref target="RFC0793">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
      </xref> is used by many applications in the Internet, including control
      and management protocols. Therefore, TCP is implemented on network
      elements that can be configured via network management protocols such as
      <xref target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref> or <xref
      target="RFC8040">RESTCONF</xref>. This document specifies a <xref
      target="RFC7950">YANG</xref> 1.1 model for configuring TCP on network
      elements that support YANG data models, and is <xref
      target="RFC8342">Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)</xref>
      compliant. This module defines a container for TCP connection, and
      includes definitions from <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server">YANG Groupings for TCP
      Clients and TCP Servers</xref>. The model has a narrow scope and focuses
      on fundamental TCP functions and basic statistics. The model can be
      augmented or updated to address more advanced or implementation-specific
      TCP features in the future.</t>

      <t>Many protocol stacks on Internet hosts use other methods to configure
      TCP, such as operating system configuration or policies. Many TCP/IP
      stacks cannot be configured by network management protocols such as
      <xref target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref> or <xref
      target="RFC8040">RESTCONF</xref>. Moreover, many existing TCP/IP stacks
      do not use YANG data models. Such TCP implementations often have other
      means to configure the parameters listed in this document, which are
      outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This specification is orthogonal to the <xref
      target="RFC4022">Management Information Base (MIB) for the Transmission
      Control Protocol (TCP)</xref>. The basic statistics defined in this
      document follow the model of the TCP MIB. An <xref target="RFC4898">TCP
      Extended Statistics MIB</xref> is also available, but this document does
      not cover such extended statistics. It is possible also to translate a
      MIB into a YANG model, for instance using <xref
      target="RFC6643">Translation of Structure of Management Information
      Version 2 (SMIv2) MIB Modules to YANG Modules</xref>. However, this
      approach is not used in this document, as such a translated model would
      not be up-to-date.</t>

      <t>There are other existing TCP-related YANG models, which are othogonal
      to this specification. Examples are:</t>

    <section title="Model Overview">
      <section title="Modeling Scope">
        <t>TCP is implemented on many different system architectures. As a
        result, there are may different and often implementation-specific ways
        to configure parameters of the TCP protocol engine. In addition, in
        many TCP/IP stacks configuration exists for different scopes:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Global configuration: Many TCP implementations have
            configuration parameters that affect all TCP connections. Typical
            examples include enabling or disabling optional protocol
            features.</t>

            <t>Interface configuration: It can be useful to use different TCP
            parameters on different interfaces, e.g., different device ports
            or IP interfaces. In that case, TCP parameters can be part of the
            interface configuration. Typical examples are the Maximum Segment
            Size (MSS) or configuration related to hardware offloading.</t>

            <t>Connection parameters: Many implementations have means to
            influence the behavior of each TCP connection, e.g., on the
            programming interface used by applications. A typical example are
            socket options in the socket API, such as disabling the Nagle
            algorithm by TCP_NODELAY. If an application uses such an
            interface, it is possible that the configuration of the
            application or application protocol includes TCP-related
            parameters. An example is the <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model">BGP YANG Model for Service
            Provider Networks </xref>.</t>

            <t>Policies: Setting of TCP parameters can also be part of system
            policies, templates, or profiles. An example would be the
            preferences defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-taps-interface">An
            Abstract Application Layer Interface to Transport
            Services</xref>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>As a result, there is no ground truth for setting certain TCP
        parameters, and traditionally different TCP implementation have used
        different modeling approaches. For instance, one implementation may
        define a given configuration parameter globally, while another one
        uses per-interface settings, and both approaches work well for the
        corresponding use cases. Also, different systems may use different
        default values. In addition, TCP can be implemented in different ways
        and design choices by the protocol engine often affect configuration
        options.</t>

        <t>Nonetheless, a number of TCP stack parameters require configuration
        by YANG models. This document therefore defines a minimal YANG model
        with fundamental parameters directly following from TCP standards.</t>

        <t>An important use case is the TCP configuration on network elements
        such as routers, which often use YANG data models. The model therefore
        specifies TCP parameters that are important on such TCP stacks.</t>

        <t>A typical example is the support of <xref
        target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref>. TCP-AO is increasingly supported on
        routers to secure routing protocols such as BGP. In that case, TCP-AO
        configuration is required on routers. The model includes the required
        TCP parameters for TCP-AO configuration. The key chain for TCP-AO can
        be modeled by the <xref target="RFC8177">YANG Data Model for Key
        Chains</xref>.</t>

        <t>Given an installed base, the model also allows enabling of the
        legacy <xref target="RFC2385">TCP MD5</xref> signature option. As the
        TCP MD5 signature option is obsoleted by TCP-AO, it is strongly
        RECOMMENDED to use TCP-AO.</t>

        <t>Similar to the <xref target="RFC4022">TCP MIB</xref>, this document
        also specifies basic statistics and a TCP connection table.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Statistics: Counters for the number of active/passive opens,
            sent and received segments, errors, and possibly other detailed
            debugging information</t>

            <t>TCP connection table: Access to status information for all TCP
            connections</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This allows implementations of <xref target="RFC4022">TCP
        MIB</xref> to migrate to the YANG model defined in this memo.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Model Design">
        <t>The YANG model defined in this document includes definitions from
        the <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server">YANG Groupings
        for TCP Clients and TCP Servers</xref>. Similar to that model, this
        specification defines YANG groupings. This allows reuse of these
        groupings in different YANG data models. It is intended that these
        groupings will be used either standalone or for TCP-based protocols as
        part of a stack of protocol-specific configuration models. An example
        could be the <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model">BGP YANG Model for
        Service Provider Networks </xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
      that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
      <xref target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref> or <xref target="RFC8040">RESTCONF
      </xref>. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) described
      in <xref target="RFC6242">Using the NETCONF protocol over SSH </xref>.
      The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement
      secure transport is <xref target="RFC8446">TLS </xref>.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC8341">Network Configuration Access Control Model
      (NACM) </xref> provides the means to restrict access for particular
      NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
      NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.</t>

      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
      default). These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in
      some network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
      data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
      network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>server configuration. Unrestricted access to all the nodes under
          server configuration, e.g. local-address or keepalive idle-timer,
          can cause connections to the server to fail or to timeout
          prematurely.</t>

          <t>client configuration. Similar to server configuration,
          unrestricted access to the nodes under client configuration can
          cause connections from the client to fail, or connections to the
          server to be redirected, and in case of keepalive, cause connections
          to timeout prematurely etc.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
      notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes
      and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>Unrestricted access to connection information of the client or
          server can be used by a malicious user to launch an attack, e.g.
          MITM.</t>

          <t>Similarly, unrestricted access to statistics of the client or
          server can be used by a malicious user to exploit any
          vulnerabilities of the system.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control access to these operations. These are the
      operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>The YANG module allows for the statistics to be cleared by
          executing the reset action. This action should therefore be
          restricted to users with the right permission.</t>
